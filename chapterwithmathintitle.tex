\chapter{$k$-safe Labeling of Petersen Graph}\label{safeklabelingpetersen}

In 1898, Petersen produced a trivalent graph with no leaves, now
called the Petersen graph~\cite{holton1993petersen}.  In this chapter
we study $k$-safe labeling for the Petersen graph. We also give upper
bound for the span of the Petersen graph. We provide necessary proof
for the upper bound.
